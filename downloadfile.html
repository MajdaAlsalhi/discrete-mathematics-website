<h3><strong> Nutritional needs </strong></h3>
 <p class="content"> A good time to talk about nutrition is during meal times.
Dianne is cutting up an apple with Hannah (three years old). She offers a piece to Hannah, saying 'Nice crunchy apple, helps keep your teeth clean.'
Through this simple statement Dianne has shared her enjoyment of nutritional food and also some information that adds to Hannah's knowledge of the benefits of eating apples. 
It is important with all age groups to keep interactions about food simple, positive, and shared in a relaxed manner. 
Talking about the flavours and textures as well as the values of foods will encourage the children's enthusiasm and pleasure. 
You can encourage children to be selective and make healthy food choices through role modelling and offering a variety of good foods.
